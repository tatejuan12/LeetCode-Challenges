# Javascript Sleep

## Problem

Given a positive integer `millis`, write an asynchronous function that sleeps for `millis`milliseconds. It can resolve any value. Return promise.

## Constraints

\-231 <= n <= 231-1

Example 1:

Input: n = 16

Output: true

Input: n=5

Output : false

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input**: millis = 100
**Output**: 100
**Explanation**: It should return a promise that resolves after 100ms.

### Example 2:

**Input**: millis = 200
**Output**: 200
**Explanation**: It should return a promise that resolves after 200ms.
